# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Hello,
this is a project of Heart Disease prediction 
Dataset is taken from kaggle
this project is done with python libraries like pandas, numpy, sklearn, keras, matplotlib,seaborn,plotly etc.
there are total 18 columns in this datasset 17 indepwndent and 1 dependent
dataset is unbalanced by 9:1 in which yes is 1 and 9 is no
We use lots of visualization techniques to see useful insights from datset like maximium heart patient is from above 60 year old and many more.
Standardization are used in some columns.
mainly three models are applied in this project
Random forest
Logistic regression
ANN
All gives approx similar accuracy but precission and recall vary in all three models.
we can improve this model more.
we can also make web app of this project using streamlit and make it a Complete end to end project.
